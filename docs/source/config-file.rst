Config File
===========
The config file is made up of multiple parts

.. code-block:: python

    'admins': ['demo_jira_username']

* Admins can be users who manage Sync2Jira. They will be cc'd in any emails regarding duplicate issues found.

.. code-block:: python

    'mailing-list': 'demo_email@demo.com'

* Mailing list is used to alert users when there is a failure. A failure email with the traceback will be sent to the email address.

.. code-block:: python

    'debug': False

* Enable or disable debugging output. This will emit on fedmsg messages and can be very noisy; not for production use.

.. code-block:: python

    'testing': True

* Testing is a flag that will determine if any changes are actually made downstream (on JIRA tickets).
  Set to false if you are developing and don't want any changes to take effect.

.. code-block:: python

    'develop': False

* If the develop flag is set to :code:`False` then Sync2Jira will perform a sentinel query after
  getting a JIRA client and failure email will be sent anytime the service fails.

.. code-block:: python

  'github_token': 'YOUR_TOKEN',

* This is where you can enter your GitHub API token.

.. code-block:: python

    'default_jira_instance': 'example'

* This is the default JIRA instance to be used if none is provided in the project.

.. code-block:: python

    'jira': {
        'example': {
            'options': {
                'server': 'https://some_jira_server_somewhere.com',
                'verify': True,
            },
            'token_auth': 'YOUR_API_TOKEN',
        },
    },

* Here you can configure multiple JIRA instances if you have projects with differing downstream JIRA instances.
  Ensure to name them appropriately, in name of the JIRA instance above is `example`.

.. code-block:: python

    "default_jira_fields": {
      "storypoints": "customfield_12310243"
    },

* The keys in the :code:`default_jira_fields` map are used as the values of the github_project_fields
  list (see below). The keys indicate how the fields in GitHub Project items correspond to
  fields in Jira issues so that these values can be synced properly. Currently, we support
  only :code:`storypoints` and :code:`priority`. By default, the value for the priority is sourced
  from the upstream :code:`priority` field, but providing a :code:`priority` key for
  :code:`default_jira_fields` will override that. Unfortunately, there is no default available
  for sourcing story points, so, the :code:`storypoints` key must be provided if projects wish
  to sync story point values, and, for our corporate Jira instance, the value should be specified
  as :code:`customfield_12310243`.

.. code-block:: python

    'map': {
            'github': {
                'GITHUB_USERNAME/Demo_project': {'project': 'FACTORY', 'component': 'gitbz',
                                                'issue_updates': [...], 'pr_updates': [...], 'mapping': [...], 'labels': [...],
                                                'owner': 'jira_username'},
            },
        },

* You can add the following to your project configuration:

    * :code:`'project'`
        * Downstream project to sync with
    * :code:`'component'`
        * Downstream component to sync with
    * :code:`sync`
        * This array contains information on what to sync from upstream repos (i.e. 'issue' and/or 'pullrequest')
    * :code:`'owner'`
        * Optional (Recommended): Alerts the owner of an issue if there are duplicate issues present
    * :code:`'qa-contact'`
        * Optional: Automatically add a QA contact field when issues are created
    * :code:`'epic-link'`
        * Optional: Pass the downstream key to automatically create an epic-link when issues are created
    * :code:`'labels': ['tag1'..]`
        * Optional: Field to have custom set labels on all downstream issues created.
    * :code:`'type'`
        * Optional: Set the issue type that will be created. The default is Bug.
    * :code:`'issue_types': {'bug': 'Bug', 'enhancement': 'Story'}`
        * Optional: Set the issue type based on GitHub labels. If none match, fall back to what :code:`type` is set to.
   * :code:`'EXD-Service': {'guild': 'SOME_GUILD', 'value': 'SOME_VALUE'}`
        * Sync custom EXD-Service field

     .. note::

            :pullrequest: After enabling PR syncing, just type "Relates to JIRA: XXXX-1234" in the comment or description of the PR to sync with a JIRA issue. After this, updates such as when it has been merged will automatically be added to the JIRA ticket.

* You can add your projects here. The :code:`'project'` field is associated
  with downstream JIRA projects, and :code:`'component'` with downstream
  components.  You can add the following to the :code:`issue_updates` array:

    * :code:`'comments'`
        * Sync comments and comment edits
    * :code:`{'tags': {'overwrite': True/False}}`
        * Sync tags, do/don't overwrite downstream tags
    * :code:`{'fixVersion': {'overwrite': True/False}}`
        * Sync fixVersion (downstream milestone), do/don't overwrite downstream fixVersion
    * :code:`{'assignee': {'overwrite': True/False}}`
        * Sync assignee (for Github only the first assignee will sync) do/don't overwrite downstream assignee
    * :code:`'description'`
        * Sync description
    * :code:`'title'`
        * Sync title
    * :code:`{'transition': True/'CUSTOM_TRANSITION'}`
        * Sync status (open/closed), Sync only status/Attempt to transition JIRA ticket to CUSTOM_TRANSITION on upstream closure
    * :code:`{'on_close': {'apply_labels': ['label', ...]}}`
        * When the upstream issue is closed, apply additional labels on the corresponding Jira ticket.
    * :code:`github_markdown`
        * If description syncing is turned on, this flag will convert Github markdown to Jira syntax. This uses the pypandoc module.
    * :code:`upstream_id`
        * If selected this will add a comment to all newly created JIRA issue in the format 'UPSTREAM_PROJECT-#1' where the number indicates the issue ID. This allows users to search for the issue on JIRA via the issue number.
    * :code:`url`
        * This flag will add the upstream url to the bottom of the JIRA ticket
    * :code:`github_project_number`
        * Specify the GitHub project number. If specified, story points and priority will be selected from this project, and other projects linked to the issues will be ignored.
    * :code:`github_project_fields`
        * Sync GitHub projects fields. e.g, storypoints, priority

    .. note::

        :Overwrite: Setting this to :code:`True` will ensure that Upstream (GitHub) values will overwrite downstream ones (i.e. if its empty upstream it'll be empty downstream)
        :CUSTOM_TRANSITION: Setting this value will get Sync2Jira to automatically transition downstream tickets once their upstream counterparts get closed. Set this to whatever 'closed' means downstream.

* You can add your projects here. The 'project' field is associated with downstream JIRA projects, and 'component' with downstream components
  You can add the following to the :code:`pr_updates` array:

    * :code:`{'merge_transition': 'CUSTOM_TRANSITION'}`
        * Sync when upstream PR gets merged. Attempts to transition JIRA ticket to CUSTOM_TRANSITION on upstream merge
    * :code:`{'link_transition': 'CUSTOM_TRANSITION'}`
        * Sync when upstream PR gets linked. Attempts to transition JIRA ticket to CUSTOM_TRANSITION on upstream link

* You can add the following to the mapping array. This array will map an upstream field to the downstream counterpart with XXX replaced.

    * :code:`{'fixVersion': 'Test XXX'}`
        * Maps upstream milestone (suppose it's called 'milestone') to downstream fixVersion with a mapping (for our example it would be 'Test milestone')

* It is strongly encouraged for teams to use the :code:`owner` field. If configured, owners will be alerted if Sync2Jira finds duplicate downstream issues.
  Further the owner will be used as a default in case the program is unable to find a valid assignee.

.. code-block:: python

    'github_project_fields': {
        'storypoints': {
          'gh_field': 'Estimate'
        },
        'priority': {
          'gh_field': 'Priority',
          'options': {
            'P0': 'Blocker',
            'P1': 'Critical',
            'P2': 'Major',
            'P3': 'Minor',
            'P4': 'Optional',
            'P5': 'Trivial'
          }
        }
    }

* Specify the GitHub project field and its mapping to Jira. The currently supportted fields are :code:`storypoints`
  and :code:`priority`.

* The :code:`gh_field` points to the GitHub field name.

* The :code:`options` key is used to specify a mapping between GitHub field values as Jira field values.
  This is particularly useful for cases like priority which uses keywords for values.

.. code-block:: python

    'filters': {
            'github': {
                # Only sync multi-type tickets from bodhi.
                'fedora-infra/bodhi': {'status': 'open', 'milestone': 4, },
            },
        }

* You can also add filters per-project. The following can be added to the filter dict:

    * :code:`status`
        * Open/Closed
    * :code:`tags`
        * List of tags to look for
    * :code:`milestone`
        * Upstream milestone status
